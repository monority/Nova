/**
 * Controlled events (Step047, contract 01-PRODUCT-VISION §16): coherent
 * SYSTEM events that modify rates for a bounded duration — never
 * destruction, never direct treasury hits (design rules §21-22). Sandbox
 * default is OFF (design rule §24).
 *
 * Determinism (ADR-007): draws are a pure function of (world seed,
 * occurrence index) — independent of player actions. The same seed
 * replays the same event sequence at the same ticks; the self-play
 * determinism contract holds unchanged.
 *
 * Timing contract (mirrors staffing): resolveEvents runs as the LAST
 * phase of a tick (phase 11, canonical phase 12 of 05-SIMULATION §3).
 * Production and commerce phases read the ACTIVE events of the previous
 * resolution — an event spawning at tick T affects tick T+1 onward.
 * Enabling spawns the first event on the next resolution; the frequency
 * cursor then governs recurrence. Disabling clears active events
 * immediately (config off = no events, deterministically).

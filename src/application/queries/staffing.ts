 *
 * - eligible mirrors assignJobs exactly: isActive (operational + not
 *   mothballed), jobCapacity > 0, road-adjacent;
 * - rank is the canonical staffing order (y asc, x asc, id) — the greedy
 *   order workers fill in;
 * - state/reason answer "why is this workplace not staffed?" with states,
 *   never instructions (design rule §7).
